Now that we have explored how to create and curate cultural data, as well as how to analyze it, the final part of this pipeline is sharing and preserving our efforts.

The figure above is from [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html), a community-driven book project that aims to provide a comprehensive guide to reproducible, ethical, inclusive, and collaborative data science, especially for those working with cultural data. I would highly recommend checking out their resources if you are interested in learning more about these topics.

## Documentation & Data Management

Documentation and data management might seem trivial or boring topics, but in actuality, they are crucial to the success of any project. Without proper documentation, it can be difficult to understand what you did, why you did it, and how you did it. This can lead to confusion, errors, and ultimately a lack of reproducibility.

Now reproducibility is not a topic we've discussed much in class, and that's because while movements like Open Science and Open Data are gaining traction, they are still relatively new to the humanities. In particular, it's not always clear what reproducibility means for cultural data.

For example, in the course, we've had multiple moments where we have seen how our interpretation shapes the data we create and how we analyze it. This means that even if we share our data and code, it might not be possible to reproduce our results exactly. This is not a bad thing, but it does mean we need to be thoughtful about how we document our work and the audience we are trying to reach.
