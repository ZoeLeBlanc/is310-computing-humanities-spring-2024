The figure above is from [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html), a community-driven book project that aims to provide a comprehensive guide to reproducible, ethical, inclusive, and collaborative data science, especially for those working with cultural data. I would highly recommend checking out their resources if you are interested in learning more about these topics.
