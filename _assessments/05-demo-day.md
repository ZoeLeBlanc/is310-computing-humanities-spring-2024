## Demo Day Groups

For our final class session, we will be grouped into thematic groups to present your project to your peers. This presentation should be a 10-20 minutes overview of your project, including a brief description of your research question, the data you created or curated, the computational methods you employed, and the results you achieved. You should also include a brief reflection on the process of working on your project, including any challenges you faced, any changes you made to your initial plan, and any future directions you would like to take with your project. Then your peer group will provide feedback on your project, including suggestions for improvement, questions about your methods or results, and any other comments they have.

For those watching the presentation, your goal is to provide constructive feedback to your peers. This feedback should be specific, actionable, and kind. You should aim to provide feedback that will help your peers improve their projects, whether that is by suggesting new methods, pointing out potential issues, or asking clarifying questions. You should also aim to provide feedback that is kind and supportive, recognizing the hard work that your peers have put into their projects.
